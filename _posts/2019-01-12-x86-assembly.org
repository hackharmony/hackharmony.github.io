* Why learn Assembly (ASM)?
You will always be a pretend-programmer unless you understand how the machine actually works. Knowing how to +write and+ read assembly is an amazing benefit to any programmer writing code for native platforms (e.g., C/C++, Rust, Swift, Golang). Being able to mentally parse disassembly lets you judge what your code is actually doing on the bare metal; great for judging the overhead of your algorithms or figuring out what some obscure, undocumented API call is actually doing. Knowing ASM also gives you a superpower—you can debug, manipulate, crack, or hack anybody’s program, whether or not they gave you the high level source for it. The latter is probably the most attractive motivation for learning assembly and is the reason I got into it.
