        If you covered up every screen in America, it still looks like it's 1995. Why has all our progress been only in software and computers? We were promised flying cars. We are still using railways and airplanes made in the 1950s or slight iterations on those prototypes. There is a reason all of our progress has been in software and not in building out our energy or transportation systems. Software is much easier—for humans. We are a thinking species, and software is essentially thoughts on a piece of ppaper written down and preserved software is a persistence store for our thoughts. And much like our thoughts can be boundless, software also has extreme unbounded possibilities. Of course you are limited by your hardware, but for all intents and purposes, whatever you think of can be implemented in the machine.

			<h2>Portals to infinity</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Phenomenological/spiritual/religious</strong>. As long as humankind thought, our minds gave us access to this most readily available form of infinity. Because we can think anything, our thoughts are infinity.</li>
				<li><strong>Outer space</strong>. This is the most obvious form of infinity we can access. The best physicists cannot tell us for sure where it ends. The modernist generation went to the moon six times in pursuit of this most obvious form of infinity.</li>
				<li><strong>Computers</strong>. Computing serves as mimetic of our minds and accordingly retains the unboundedness of thought. I can think anything in my mind, and a computer can think anything in its mind. Computing is the postmodernist generation's attempt at transcendence.</li>
			</ul>

			Yes, there are strict hardware limits; you cannot (for the time being) simulate a universe on an Intel processor. Yet you cannot similarly expect to reach the furthest reaches of outer space or think the deepest religious thoughts beyond your faculties. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">simple computers we use today</a> can simulate any thought or brain in theory.

		<p>
			Infinity creates substrate for unbounded creativity.

			<h2>Moving something from physical to computational</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			Think money moving from paper to numbers on a database in a bank's server. Think the source of entertainment revenue moving from trips tocinemas to in-app game purchases.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whenever this happens, what was physical and existing in the world of atoms takes the shape of bits and plays in the same unbounded arena as bits. Consider a mansion. They are scarce by necessity of land on the planet. If mansions were converted into information by way of virtual reality, then everyone can have a mansion; the marginal cost of replication is essentially zero.
		</p>
		<p>
			That which exists purely computationally has this extreme, unparallled advantage. <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere">Write once, run a million times</a></em>. Constructs transferred from the physical to the computational are immediately imbued with <em>boundless</em>ness of computation. If your business has a choice between making economically equivalent widgets out of plastic versus bits, it would seem catastrophically foolish to choose plastic.

				All it takes is belief
			</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			In many ways the computer revolution has not happened. Most of our processes still take place in the necessarily bounded world.
		<p>
			The more trust we put into computing, the more we are willing to accept the virtualized over the physical, the closer we get to infinity.
